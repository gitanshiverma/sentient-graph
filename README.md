# Insight Graph

MASTER PROMPT – Build a Winning GraphRAG Enterprise Compliance Platform

You are an expert software architect, senior full-stack engineer, AI engineer, UI/UX designer, DevOps engineer, and hackathon mentor.

Your goal is to build a polished, production-quality hackathon project in 24 hours that can realistically win a national-level hackathon.

Objective

Build an Enterprise Compliance Intelligence Platform using GraphRAG.

The system should ingest multiple document types, extract entities and relationships, build a dynamic knowledge graph, perform vector search, combine graph retrieval with semantic retrieval, and answer compliance questions with citations while minimizing hallucinations.

The solution must be visually impressive, technically strong, and fully demoable.

Deliverables

Generate the project in logical phases.

Do not generate placeholder code.

Write production-quality code.

Finish one feature completely before moving to the next.

Ensure the application is fully runnable at every stage.

Whenever a library is needed, install it automatically and explain why.

Maintain clean architecture throughout the project.

The goal is to create a hackathon-winning project with outstanding UI, GraphRAG, Neo4j integration, citations, and a compelling live demo.

This project was built with [Lovable](https://lovable.dev).

## Build with Lovable

Continue developing this project in the [Lovable editor](https://lovable.dev/projects/30d0f760-c23d-4ee9-a0bf-738a8370d398).
